# 🚀 Vercel Deployment Guide

## ✅ Issue Fixed!

The "No Next.js version detected" error has been resolved. Your project is now properly configured for Vercel deployment as a **React + Vite** application.

## 📁 What Was Changed:

### 1. **Added vercel.json Configuration**
- Configured for Vite framework instead of Next.js
- Set proper build commands and output directory
- Added API routes handling

### 2. **Created Vercel Serverless Functions**
- `/api/upload.js` - File upload endpoint
- `/api/create-payment-intent.js` - Stripe payment processing
- `/api/health.js` - Health check endpoint

### 3. **Converted Express Backend**
- Transformed Express server to Vercel serverless functions
- Maintained all payment and file upload functionality

## 🔧 Environment Variables Needed:

In your Vercel dashboard, add these environment variables:

```bash
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_your_stripe_secret_key
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_your_stripe_publishable_key
NODE_ENV=production
```

## 📡 API Endpoints (Updated):

Your frontend components should now call:

- **Health Check**: `GET /api/health`
- **File Upload**: `POST /api/upload`
- **Payment Intent**: `POST /api/create-payment-intent`
